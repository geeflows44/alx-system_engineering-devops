What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?
When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a complex chain of events takes place behind the scenes to deliver your request. I will explore the various stages involved in this process, including DNS request, TCP/IP, Firewall, HTTPS/SSL, Load-balancer, Web server, Application server, and Database.
1. DNS request: The first step in accessing any website is to resolve its domain name into an IP address. This process is called Domain Name System (DNS) resolution. When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser, your device sends a DNS request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.
2. TCP/IP: Once the IP address is resolved, your device establishes a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connection with the server hosting the website. This connection is a reliable and secure way to exchange data between devices online.
3. Firewall: Firewall is a security measure that protects servers from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. The Firewall checks the incoming traffic to ensure that it complies with the pre-configured rules and policies. If the traffic is deemed safe, it is allowed to pass through to the next stage.
4. HTTPS/SSL: The next stage involves establishing a secure connection between your device and the server using the HTTPS/SSL protocol. HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, and SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. This protocol ensures that the data exchanged between your device and the server is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.
5. Load-balancer: This is a device that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overloaded. When you access google.com, there may be thousands of requests coming in at the same time. A load balancer helps to distribute these requests across multiple servers, ensuring that each server has an equal load.
6. Web server: It
 is responsible for serving the requested web pages to your device. When you access "https://www.google.com," your request is routed to one of Google's many web servers. The web server retrieves the requested web pages from its file system.
7. Application server: The application server is responsible for executing the code that generates the web page dynamically. In the case of Google, the application server executes the code that generates the search results page by communicating with the web server to retrieve any required data, and formats it into an HTML page that can be rendered by your browser.
 8. Database: The final stage involves retrieving data from the database. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve any required data. In the case of Google, the application server retrieves data from Google's massive database of search results.
